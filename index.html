        <h1>HTML Global Attributes</h1>
        <p><strong>Global attributes</strong> are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements.</p>

        <p>Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. That means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though using those elements means that the document is no longer HTML5-compliant. For example, HTML5-compliant browsers hide content marked as <code>foo hidden...foo</code>, even though <code>foo</code> is not a valid HTML element.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to the basic HTML global attributes, the following global attributes also exist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ml:lang</strong> and <strong>xml:base</strong> — these are inherited from the XHTML specifications and deprecated, but kept for compatibility purposes.</li>
            <li>The multiple <strong>aria-*</strong> attributes, used for improving accessibility.</li>
            <li>The event handler attributes: <i>onabort, onautocomplete, onautocompleteerror, onblur, oncancel, oncanplay, oncanplaythrough, onchange, onclick, onclose, oncontextmenu, oncuechange, ondblclick, ondrag, ondragend, ondragenter, ondragexit, ondragleave, ondragover, ondragstart, ondrop, ondurationchange, onemptied, onended, onerror, onfocus, oninput, oninvalid, onkeydown, onkeypress, onkeyup, onload, onloadeddata, onloadedmetadata, onloadstart, onmousedown, onmouseenter, onmouseleave, onmousemove, onmouseout, onmouseover, onmouseup, onmousewheel, onpause, onplay, onplaying, onprogress, onratechange, onreset, onresize, onscroll, onseeked, onseeking, onselect, onshow, onsort, onstalled, onsubmit, onsuspend, ontimeupdate, ontoggle, onvolumechange, onwaiting.</i></li>
        </ul>

            off or none, no autocapitalization is applied (all letters default to lowercase)
            on or sentences, the first letter of each sentence defaults to a capital letter; all other letters default to lowercase
            words, the first letter of each word defaults to a capital letter; all other letters default to lowercase
            characters, all letters should default to uppercase</td>

            <td class="firstcol">contenteditable</td>

            true or the empty string, which indicates that the element must be editable;
            false, which indicates that the element must not be editable.</td>

            <td class="firstcol">dir</td>
            <td>An enumerated attribute indicating the directionality of the element's text. It can have the following values:
            ltr, which means left to right and is to be used for languages that are written from the left to the right (like English);
            rtl, which means right to left and is to be used for languages that are written from the right to the left (like Arabic);
            auto, which lets the user agent decide. It uses a basic algorithm as it parses the characters inside the element until it finds a character with a strong directionality, then it applies that directionality to the whole element.</td>

This attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be shown.</td>

            <td>Contains CSS styling declarations to be applied to the element. Note that it is recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file or files. This attribute and the style element have mainly the purpose of allowing for quick styling, for example for testing purposes.</td>

            <td class="firstcol">tabindex</td>
            <td>An integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation, and if so, at what position. It can take several values:
            a negative value means that the element should be focusable, but should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation;
            0 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but its relative order is defined by the platform convention;
            a positive value means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation; the order in which the elements are focused is the increasing value of the tabindex. If several elements share the same tabindex, their relative order follows their relative positions in the document.</td>

            <td>An enumerated attribute that is used to specify whether an element's attribute values and the values of its Text node children are to be translated when the page is localized, or whether to leave them unchanged. It can have the following values:
            empty string and yes, which indicates that the element will be translated.
            no, which indicates that the element will not be translated.</td>
